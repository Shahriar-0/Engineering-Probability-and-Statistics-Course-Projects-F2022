# Engineering Probability and Statistics

This repository contains the projects for the engineering probability and statistics course at Tehran university.

## Intro

This file is just an introduction to R if you are not familiar with it. If you are, you can skip this part.

## Project 1 - Probability Limit Definition

In this project, want to see how the probability limit definition works. For this, we simulate an experiment on dice and compare the calculated probability with the theoretical one. After that, we take a look at the famous birthday paradox and try to understand it.
