## Intro

This file is just an introduction to R if you are not familiar with it. If you are, you can skip this part.

## Project 1 - Probability Limit Definition

In this project, want to see how the probability limit definition works. For this, we simulate an experiment on dice and compare the calculated probability with the theoretical one. After that, we take a look at the famous birthday paradox and try to understand it.

## Project 2 - Conditional Probability

In this project, we will see how conditional probability works. We simulated the famous monte hall problem and compare the calculated probability with the theoretical one. We also examined how a Bayesian Model works.

## Project 3 - Distributions

In this project, we checked different distributions in R and see how they work. We looked at binomial, hypergeometric, and Poisson distributions and more and tried to implement them in R.

## Project 4 - Central Limit Theorem

In this project, we tried to see how the central limit theorem works. We also tried to estimate binomial distribution using the other distributions.

## Project 5 - Beta Distribution

In this project, we tried to see how beta distribution works and we worked with covariance and correlation and tried to implement them in R.

## Project 6
